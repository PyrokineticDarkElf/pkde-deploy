# Changelog

## 2026.10.21

- First public release: the reusable deploy workflow (checks out its own tools at the tag stamped in the workflow, no token needed) and the deploy tools (activate-release, assemble/check-artifact, retry, rcpt-probe, drift-check, W3TC standard, perf-probe, wp.sh, pre-launch audit, layout fingerprint, native-block tools, ADR sync, check-site-paths) with their tests. GPL-2.0-or-later, SECURITY.md, a secret scan and a public-safety test in CI. check-artifact requires the Sage kit's provider and forbids its tests, docs and metadata in the docroot.
